# Lecture

- best channel to convey information = vision
	- highest bandwidth of all the senses
	- extends memory and cognition – we use drawings to “think more clearly”
	- people think visually
- pre-attentive perception
	- the time to find the blue dot is constant – no matter the total number of dots
		- assuming we can distinguish the colors
- Anscombe's Quartet – four datasets with the same statistical properties
- when computing average, we assume that it represents the underlying distribution well
- information visualization = use of computer-supported, interactive visual representations of data to amplify cognition
- scientific visualization – the datasets have a given spatialisation (the coordinates already exist), continuous
- data visualization – web-based, communication
- challenges: diversity, scale
- visual information-seeking mantra
	- overview first
	- zoom and filter
	- details on demand
- visual perception is a two stage process
	- parallel extraction of low-level properties
	- sequential goal-directed processing
- retina performs parallel processing of different attributes
- brain performs sequential processing (object segmentation, identification)
