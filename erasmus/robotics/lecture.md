- robot = mechatronic system with perception, decision and action capabilities, that can perform in an autonomous way different tasks in the real world
	- multi-purpose
	- autonomous
- sensor = device that measures a physical property and returns a signal of varying complexity
	- exteroception – information from the outside world
	- interoception – information from within the body of a robot
	- proprioception – information from within related to the movement of the body parts
- actuator = device generating a movement, that controls one degree of freedom (rotation, translation)
	- LED is not an actuator :(
	- effector … more complex for manipulation or mobility
- the three Ds: dull, dirty, dangerous (tasks)
- odometric drift – actuators and sensors are not precise, the error accumulates
	- how to solve it
		- use a map (purposes of a map: localization, computing the route to a given goal)
- motion planning
	- feasible plan = takes the capabilities of the robot into account
	- motion strategies can have different forms – it can be a path, a set of procedural instructions
	- for a walking humanoid robot, the plan would be quite complex
- motion planning vs. navigation (obstacle avoidance etc.)
	- motion planning – global map, strategic level
	- obstacle avoidance – local map, tactical level
