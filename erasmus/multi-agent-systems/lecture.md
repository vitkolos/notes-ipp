# Lecture

- challenges in AI (or computer science in general): scale, autonomy, delegation, cooperation
- MAS … field of AI interested in designing systems of autonomous interacting entities
- course overview
	- general introduction
	- agent interactions: communication, game theory
	- distributed problem solving
	- agent-based modelling and simulation (course, case study, tutorials)
	- human factors in MAS
	- collective decisions in MAS: theory of social choice
- agent … perceiving and acting
- autonomy (but autonomous agent still could decide randomly)
- rational agent
- another definition: agent
	- physical or virtual entity, has its own resources, possibly a representation of its environment
	- acts autonomously to satisfy some tendencies (goals) … proactive
	- while taking into account its limited resources, perceptions etc. … reactive
- physical vs. communicative actions
- agent architectures
	- simple reactive agent
	- agent with an internal state
	- goal-based agent
	- utility-based agent
		- in case of conflicting goals or uncertain effects
- performance vs. utility
- properties of environments
	- accessibility
		- are all the relevant aspects of the environment instantly available to the agent? → we don't need to maintain an internal state
	- determinism
		- is the next state completely determined by the current state and the actions selected by the agents?
	- accessible + deterministic → no uncertainty
	- episodic vs. sequential environment
		- do future states depend on past actions? → sequential environment
		- episodic environments are simpler, agents can make reactive decisions and do not need to remember the history (example: old chatbots)
	- static vs. dynamic environment
		- dynamic environment can change during deliberation → we need to think fast (example: autonomous car)
		- semi-dynamic environment does not change during deliberation but the passage of time is important (e.g. performance score)
		- static environment does not change during deliberation, time does not matter
	- discrete vs. continuous
		- discrete environment – limited number of distinct, clearly defined percepts and actions
- examples
	- chess: accessible, deterministic, sequential, static or semi-dynamic (with a clock), discrete
	- poker: inaccessible, indeterministic, sequential
	- taxi driving: inaccessible, indeterministic, sequential, dynamic, continuous
- finding a balance between reactivity and proactivity (so that we don't get distracted)
- applications
	- distributed problem solving
	- agent-based modelling and simulation
