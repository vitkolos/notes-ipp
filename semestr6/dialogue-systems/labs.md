# Labs

- at least 50% homework to get the credit
- we will get the feedback approximately a week after the deadline (or later)
- we should create the merge request before the deadline
	- (it is okay to make a tiny change after the deadline if we found a bug)
- we should run the automated tests before we create the merge request
	- the tests should not crash, they may not pass
- first assignment
	- we can switch the domain later
	- but we should imagine two domains
	- at least one of them should be our preferred
	- we want a **task-oriented** system
		- anything that operates on top of a database or API
	- we don't need to focus on parsing errors (or misunderstanding) in the flowchart
	- we can use anything as the backend â€“ even a local file
- second assignment
	- look at the data in `data/hw2` (only the train data?)
	- write a script that separates the user and the system turns
	- some search calls (after silence) will be parts of the text
		- we ignore only the lines without tabs
	- don't forget to comment the results
	- we should run the tests locally
